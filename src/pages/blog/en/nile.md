I designed and developed a modern, user-centric website for Nile, a fitness services company. From conceptualizing the brand identity to implementing the design, my focus was on creating a visually stunning and easy-to-navigate experience.

This project allowed me to merge my creativity with my technical skills to meet the client's needs and meet their business objectives.
