I designed HotelBlog, an informative blog about architecture and outstanding works, with a focus on a formal but modern style. I used eye-catching visual elements to attract the user's attention while transmitting confidence and professionalism.

\
In addition, I implemented an artificial intelligence tool to streamline the design and obtain relevant information about the topic. The end result was a modern and reliable experience for users interested in architecture.
